# My Personal Website

## About
Welcome to my personal website! This is a platform where I share my journey as a developer, showcase my projects, highlight my skills, and provide a way for you to get in touch with me.

In the v0 folder, you can find the first version of the website. I pushed it here to keep a record of its existence, but it was eventually replaced as my tastes evolves quickly over time.
